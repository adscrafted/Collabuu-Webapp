# CRITICAL DIFFERENCES: iOS vs Webapp Campaign Edit

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

## Top 5 Critical Issues to Address

### 1. WHITESPACE HANDLING - AFFECTS DATA INTEGRITY
**Severity:** HIGH - Could cause data consistency issues

**iOS:** Sends UNTRIMMED values to API
```swift
title: title  // Includes leading/trailing whitespace
```

**Webapp:** Sends TRIMMED values to API
```tsx
title: data.title  // Whitespace removed by zod.trim()
```

**Impact:** Same campaign data will be stored differently depending on platform
**Fix:** Make both platforms consistent (recommend trimming on webapp is correct approach)

---

### 2. DATE FORMAT MISMATCH - BACKEND ACCEPTS BOTH BUT RISKY
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Works but fragile

**iOS sends:** `"2025-12-31T00:00:00Z"` (ISO8601 full datetime)
**Webapp sends:** `"2025-12-31"` (date only)

**Backend handling:** Both formats work via `new Date()` constructor, but this is implicit and fragile

**Fix:** Standardize to one format. Recommend ISO8601 for consistency.

---

### 3. FORM FIELD LABEL INCONSISTENCY - UX ISSUE
**Severity:** LOW - Visual only

**iOS:** "Campaign Details"
**Webapp:** "Description"

**Impact:** Users see different labels on different platforms
**Fix:** Standardize to "Description" (more standard form term)

---

### 4. SUCCESS NOTIFICATION FLOW TIMING - UX DIFFERENCE
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Different user experience

**iOS:** Shows modal alert → waits for user to dismiss → navigates
```swift
toast -> dismiss()
```

**Webapp:** Shows toast → immediately navigates
```tsx
toast() -> router.push()
```

**Impact:** Toast on webapp may not be visible if navigation is instant
**Fix:** Either wait for user to dismiss, or use non-dismissible notification during transition

---

### 5. NULL DATE HANDLING - DATA INCONSISTENCY
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Could create missing data

**iOS:** Defaults null date to current `Date()`
```swift
startDate = campaign.periodStart ?? Date()
```

**Webapp:** Defaults null date to empty string `''`
```tsx
startDate: campaign.startDate?.split('T')[0] || ''
```

**When saving:**
- iOS might inadvertently set campaign to start TODAY if data was missing
- Webapp keeps it as empty

**Fix:** Define explicit behavior: reject null dates, or validate before save

---

## Secondary Issues (Lower Priority)

### Message Text Differences
- Success: "Campaign updated successfully" (iOS) vs "Your changes have been saved successfully" (webapp)
- Delete message: "(Cannot edit - date has passed)" (iOS) vs "Cannot edit - date has passed" (webapp, no parentheses)

### Button Text Loading States
- Delete button: Shows "Delete Campaign" while loading (iOS) vs "Deleting..." (webapp)
- Recommend standardizing to "Deleting..." for better UX

### Navigation After Delete
- iOS: Dismisses to previous screen
- Webapp: Navigates to `/campaigns` list
- Both are valid, but maintain consistency

### Section Descriptions Missing
- iOS: Has no CardDescription subtitles like "Update your campaign's basic details"
- Webapp: Has helpful descriptions
- Consider adding to iOS for feature parity

---

## Validation - FULLY COMPLIANT

Both platforms validate identically:
- Title, description, requirements all required (with trimming)
- Dates are optional
- Validation happens only on submit (no real-time validation)
- Error messages are identical

**No action needed.**

---

## Date Comparison Logic - IDENTICAL

Both platforms use `>` operator for checking if date is in future:
- iOS: `campaign.periodStart ?? Date() > Date()`
- Webapp: `new Date(campaign.startDate) > new Date()`

**No action needed.**

---

## Delete Confirmation Messages - IDENTICAL

Both show: "Are you sure you want to delete this campaign? Your credits will be refunded to your account. This action cannot be undone."

**No action needed.**

## Quick Fix Checklist

```
[ ] 1. Normalize whitespace handling (trim on iOS, keep current on webapp)
[ ] 2. Standardize date format (choose ISO8601 or date-only)
[ ] 3. Change iOS label "Campaign Details" to "Description"
[ ] 4. Fix success notification flow (wait for dismissal or non-dismissible)
[ ] 5. Define null date behavior (reject or validate)
[ ] 6. Optionally: Standardize loading text to "Deleting..."
[ ] 7. Optionally: Add section descriptions to iOS for parity
```
