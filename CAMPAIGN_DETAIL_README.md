GET    /campaigns/:id/metrics                   # Get campaign metrics
GET    /campaigns/:id/applications              # Get applications list
GET    /campaigns/:id/participants              # Get participants list
GET    /campaigns/:id/visits                    # Get visit history
GET    /campaigns/:id/activity                  # Get activity timeline

PATCH  /campaigns/:id                           # Update campaign
PATCH  /campaigns/:id/status                    # Update status
DELETE /campaigns/:id                           # Delete campaign

POST   /campaigns/:id/applications/:appId/approve   # Approve application
POST   /campaigns/:id/applications/:appId/reject    # Reject application
DELETE /campaigns/:id/participants/:participantId   # Remove participant
```

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are already installed in package.json:
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching and caching
- `date-fns` - Date formatting
- `react-hook-form` - Form management
- `zod` - Form validation
- `@hookform/resolvers` - Form resolver
- shadcn/ui components - UI components

## Usage

### Navigate to Campaign Detail:
```typescript
// From campaign list
router.push(`/campaigns/${campaignId}`);
```

### Edit Campaign:
```typescript
// From detail page
router.push(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/edit`);
```

### Hook Usage Example:
```typescript
const { data: campaign, isLoading } = useCampaign(campaignId);
const updateStatus = useUpdateCampaignStatus(campaignId);

await updateStatus.mutateAsync(CampaignStatus.PAUSED);
```

## Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layout, stacked cards
- Tablet: 2-column grid for cards
- Desktop: 3-4 column grid, side-by-side layout

Breakpoints used:
- `sm:` - 640px
- `md:` - 768px
- `lg:` - 1024px

## Performance Optimizations

1. **React Query Caching:**
   - 5-minute stale time for campaign data
   - 30-second auto-refetch for metrics
   - Intelligent cache invalidation

2. **Code Splitting:**
   - Tab content lazy loaded

3. **Optimistic Updates:**
   - Immediate UI feedback on actions
